**WORKS COMPLETELY FINE. SHOULD BE LONG-LIVED.**

UPD: NOW UTILIZES CONDA FOR PROPER INSTALLATION
Which means that it now acts as a normal Faceswap installation.

The unofficial notebook used in Google Colab. Provided with ease of use and flexibility of configuration.

List of features:

  * Extract/Train/Convert
  * *Faceswap Configuration*(*won't be done in the near future*)
  * Conda Environment and more to be in plans.

To open this notebook, just to to Google Colab -> File -> Open Notebook -> GitHub -> paste the link of this repository.
Or just click the "Open in Colab" button.

Keep-Alive code snippet doesn't seem to work. You'll have to inject that code seperately in the console. *sorry mobile users, i'll find a workaround just for you ;)*
